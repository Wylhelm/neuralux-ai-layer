**[0:00 - 0:15] HOOK & INTRO**

What if your Linux system could understand you like a colleague? What if instead of 
memorizing commands, you could just ask? Meet NeuraLux - an AI-powered layer that 
transforms how you interact with Linux.

**[0:15 - 0:45] THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION**

We've all been there. You need to find large files eating up disk space, but you can't 
remember the find command syntax. Or you want to check what's using CPU, but grep and 
awk feel like overkill. NeuraLux changes this.

It's a complete AI layer for Linux that runs locally, respects your privacy, and 
understands natural language. Let me show you.

**[0:45 - 1:15] CLI DEMO - NATURAL LANGUAGE COMMANDS**

Here's the AI shell - we call it "aish". Instead of cryptic commands, just ask naturally.

"Show me large files in my downloads folder"

NeuraLux generates the exact command, explains what it does, and asks for confirmation. 
Safe, transparent, and educational.

"What's using the most CPU?"

Instant results. No man pages. No Stack Overflow. Just natural conversation with your system.

Need to explain a complex command? Just ask.

"Explain this Docker command"

Clear, plain-English explanations right in your terminal.

**[1:15 - 1:50] OVERLAY ASSISTANT - GUI POWER**

But NeuraLux isn't just for the terminal. Press Ctrl+Space anywhere, and you get an 
intelligent overlay assistant.

Type naturally or use slash commands. It understands context - what window you're in, 
what you're working on.

Need to search the web? Just ask. NeuraLux fetches results, summarizes them, and lets 
you approve before opening URLs. Privacy first, always.

**[1:50 - 2:20] VOICE INTERFACE**

Don't want to type? Use your voice.

Click the mic button and speak naturally. NeuraLux transcribes with Whisper, processes 
with a local LLM, and can even read responses back to you. All happening on your machine. 
No cloud. No latency. Complete privacy.

**[2:20 - 2:45] OCR & SMART ACTIONS**

Here's something powerful - OCR any window with one click.

NeuraLux extracts the text, then offers smart actions: copy it, summarize it, translate 
it, or even extract tables. Continue the conversation with context, or start fresh.

Perfect for processing documents, screenshots, or anything visual on your screen.

**[2:45 - 3:05] SYSTEM INTELLIGENCE**

NeuraLux also monitors your system health in real-time. CPU, memory, disk, network, 
even GPU metrics.

Beautiful dashboards. Anomaly detection. Intelligent alerts. Your system's vital signs, 
always accessible.

And it's semantic file search? It doesn't just match filenames - it understands content. 
Find documents by what they're about, not what they're called.

**[3:05 - 3:30] CLOSING - THE VISION**

This is just Phase 2 of the NeuraLux vision. We're building gesture recognition, 
temporal intelligence to query your system's history, and advanced automation.

All local-first. All privacy-respecting. All open source under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

NeuraLux runs on Ubuntu with an NVIDIA GPU, but we're expanding to more hardware and 
distributions.

**[3:30 - 3:35] CALL TO ACTION**

## DEMO SEQUENCE SUGGESTIONS

1. **Terminal clips**: Show natural language → command generation → execution
2. **Overlay clips**: Show Ctrl+Space activation, fuzzy search, voice input
3. **OCR demo**: Screen capture → text extraction → smart actions
4. **Health dashboard**: Live system metrics with GPU stats
5. **Settings window**: Show model selection, configuration options
6. **B-roll**: Code editor, terminal aesthetics, smooth transitions

## PACING NOTES

- Keep energy high in first 30 seconds (hook)
- Slow slightly for technical demos (show, don't just tell)
- Build excitement toward vision/roadmap
- End with clear, confident call to action

## MUSIC SUGGESTIONS

- Upbeat, modern tech soundtrack
- Slightly cinematic for intro/outro
- Subtle during demos (let features shine)
- Build toward climax at vision section
