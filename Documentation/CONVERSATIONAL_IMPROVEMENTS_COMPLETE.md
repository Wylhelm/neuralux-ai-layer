# Conversational Intelligence - Recent Improvements

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

## 🎯 Overview

This document summarizes the major improvements made to the conversational intelligence system, making it the default and primary interface for Neuralux.

## ✨ Major Improvements

### 1. **Document Query Display** ✅
**Problem:** Document search results were shown as bulk text, making it hard to browse and select documents.

**Solution:**
- Formatted results in a beautiful table with document name, relevance score, and preview
- Added numbered list for easy reference
- Integrated document opening: "open document 1" or "show me doc 2"
- Results are stored in context for follow-up actions

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/cli/aish/conversational_mode.py` - Display formatting
- `packages/common/neuralux/action_planner.py` - Document opening patterns
- `packages/common/neuralux/orchestrator.py` - Context variable storage

**Example:**
```
You: search my documents for Python tutorials

Found 5 documents matching 'Python tutorials':

# │ Document                     │ Relevance │ Preview
──┼──────────────────────────────┼───────────┼────────────────────────────
1 │ python_basics.md             │ 0.95      │ Complete guide to Python...
2 │ advanced_python_patterns.txt │ 0.87      │ Design patterns for...

Tip: To open a document, say 'open document 1' or 'show me document 2'

You: open document 1
[shows file contents]
```

---

### 2. **Web Search Integration** ✅
**Problem:** Web search functionality was not integrated into conversational mode.

**Solution:**
- Added `web_search` action type to the orchestrator
- Implemented DuckDuckGo search integration
- Beautiful formatted results with title, URL, and snippet
- Link opening support: "open link 1" or "visit site 2"
- Results stored in context for follow-up

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/common/neuralux/conversation.py` - Added `WEB_SEARCH` action type
- `packages/common/neuralux/orchestrator.py` - Implemented web search executor
- `packages/common/neuralux/action_planner.py` - Added search patterns
- `packages/cli/aish/conversational_mode.py` - Display formatting

**Example:**
```
You: search the web for Python 3.12 new features

Found 5 web results for 'Python 3.12 new features':

# │ Title                        │ URL                           │ Snippet
──┼──────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┼──────────────

2 │ Python 3.12 Release Notes    │ https://www.python.org/do...  │ This article exp...

Tip: To open a link, say 'open link 1' or 'visit site 2'

You: open link 1
[opens browser]
```

---

### 3. **Conversational Mode as Default** ✅
**Problem:** Users had to explicitly run `aish converse` to access conversational mode.

**Solution:**
- Made conversational mode the default when running `aish` with no arguments
- Removed old `ask` command that had outdated functionality
- Streamlined CLI to focus on conversational interaction
- Kept useful specialized commands: `ocr`, `web`, `status`, `overlay`

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/cli/aish/main.py` - Updated default behavior

**Before:**
```bash
aish                 # Started old interactive mode
aish converse        # Started conversational mode
```

**After:**
```bash
aish                 # Starts conversational mode (new default!)
aish ocr             # Run OCR command
aish web python      # Web search command
aish status          # Check service status
```

---

### 4. **Command Output Display** ✅
**Problem:** When commands were executed (like `docker ps -a`), their output wasn't shown to the user.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced result display to show full `stdout` and `stderr`
- Smart truncation for very long outputs (10,000 chars or 100 lines)
- Clear formatting with context

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/cli/aish/conversational_mode.py` - Enhanced `_show_result`

**Example:**
```
You: docker ps -a

✓ Execute: docker ps -a

Output:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       STATUS
a1b2c3d4e5f6   nginx:latest   "nginx..."    Up 2 hours
...

[Output shows full command results]
```

---

### 5. **Overlay Integration Preparation** ✅
**Problem:** Overlay needs to use the new conversational mode system.

**Solution:**
- Documented comprehensive integration plan
- Identified overlay-specific commands to keep separate
- Created phased migration strategy
- No breaking changes to existing overlay functionality

**Files Created:**
- `Documentation/OVERLAY_CONVERSATIONAL_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide

**Key Points:**
- Overlay will use conversational mode for AI interactions
- Overlay-specific commands (OCR, voice, TTS) remain separate
- Shared context between CLI and overlay
- Gradual, tested migration approach

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Action Types (Complete List)

1. **`llm_generate`** - Generate text with LLM
2. **`image_generate`** - Generate images with AI
3. **`image_save`** - Save generated images to disk
4. **`ocr_capture`** - Extract text from screen/images
5. **`document_query`** - Search indexed documents (RAG)
6. **`web_search`** - Search the web (DuckDuckGo)
7. **`command_execute`** - Execute shell commands (requires approval)

### Context Variables

The system maintains these context variables for reference resolution:

- `last_generated_text` - Output from `llm_generate`
- `last_generated_image` - Path to generated image
- `last_saved_image` - Path to saved image
- `last_ocr_text` - Extracted OCR text
- `last_query_results` - Document search results
- `last_query` - Last document search query
- `last_search_results` - Web search results
- `last_search_query` - Last web search query
- `last_created_file` - Path to created file
- `working_directory` - Current working directory

### Reference Resolution

Users can naturally refer to previous results:
- "save **it** to Pictures" → uses `last_generated_image`
- "open **document 3**" → uses `last_query_results[2]`
- "visit **link 2**" → uses `last_search_results[1]`
- "read **that file**" → uses `last_created_file`
