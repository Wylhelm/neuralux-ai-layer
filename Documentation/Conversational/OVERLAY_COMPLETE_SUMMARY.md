## Current Status

**Overlay is running successfully:**
```
✓ Connected to NATS
✓ Conversation handler initialized (27 turns loaded)
✓ Message bus connected
✓ All services operational
```

## If "Thinking Forever" Happens

### Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Check services are running:**
```bash
cd ~/NeuroTuxLayer
source myenv/bin/activate
aish status
```

2. **Check logs in real-time:**
```bash
# In one terminal:
tail -f ~/NeuroTuxLayer/data/logs/overlay.log

# Try chatting in the overlay and watch for:
# - "Processing message"
# - "planning_actions"  
# - Any timeout or error messages
```

3. **Restart everything if needed:**
```bash
cd ~/NeuroTuxLayer
source myenv/bin/activate

# Stop all
./scripts/stop-all.sh
pkill -f "aish overlay"

# Start all
./scripts/start-all.sh
sleep 3
aish overlay &
```

## Test Commands

Try these to verify everything works:

1. **Simple greeting:**
   - "hello, how are you?"
   - Should respond quickly (< 5 seconds)

2. **Command execution:**
   - "list files in my home directory"
   - Should show approval card, then full `ls` output

3. **Image generation** (if vision service running):
   - "generate an image of a sunset"
   - Should show 400x400 preview

## Key Timeouts

- **LLM planning**: 45 seconds max
- **Total operation**: 50 seconds max
- **LLM response**: Usually < 5 seconds

If it takes longer than 10 seconds for a simple message, something is wrong:
- Check if LLM service is responding: `tail -f ~/NeuroTuxLayer/data/logs/llm-service.log`
- Check NATS connection: `docker ps | grep nats`
