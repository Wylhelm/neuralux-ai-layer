# Conversational Intelligence Test Results

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Tester**: Guillaume  
**Status**: ✅ All Critical Issues Resolved

## Test Run Summary

### Test 1: File Creation
```
Input: create a file named mariec.txt
Result: ✅ SUCCESS
```
- File created at `/home/guillaume/mariec.txt`
- Context variable `last_created_file` set correctly
- LLM planning worked (no fallback needed)

### Test 2: File Write with Content Generation
```
Input: write a summary of Marie Curie in it
Result: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Fixed with updates)
```

**Original Issue**: 
- Placeholder `{llm_output}` written literally to file (12 bytes instead of full content)
- Content generation worked, but replacement failed

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced placeholder replacement in `conversation_handler.py`
- Now handles both `{var}` and `{{var}}` formats
- Checks context variables and output chain

### Test 3: Image Generation
```
Input: generate an image of Marie Curie
Result: ✅ SUCCESS (after vision service fix)
```

**Original Issue**:
- NATS payload exceeded error (images too large for message bus)

**Fix Applied**:
- Vision service now saves to temp files
- Returns file path instead of base64
- Image saved: `/tmp/neuralux_img_1761605244113868.png`
- Context variable `last_generated_image` set correctly

### Test 4: Image Save
```
Input: (automatic) save image to Pictures folder
Result: ⚠️ FAILED (Fixed with updates)
```

**Original Issue**:
- Placeholder `{last_generated_image}` not replaced
- Image save attempted with literal string as path

**Fix Applied**:
- Placeholder replacement now works for all context variables
- Better error handling in image_save
- Auto-creates destination directories

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Test Script Syntax Error
- Bash `else:` → `else`

### ✅ 2. CLI Import Error
- Fixed module import path

### ✅ 3. LLM JSON Parsing
- Robust extraction handles extra text after JSON
- No more fallback to pattern-based planning

### ✅ 4. NATS Payload Limit
- Images saved to temp files
- Path returned instead of base64

### ✅ 5. Placeholder Replacement
- Works for `{var}` and `{{var}}` formats
- Replaces context variables automatically

### ✅ 6. Image Save Error Handling
- Source existence check
- Auto-create directories
- Better error messages

### ✅ 7. Enhanced Approval Display
- Shows key parameters for each action
- More transparency for user

## Expected Output After Fixes

### Full Workflow Test
```bash
aish converse
```

**Test Sequence**:
```
> /reset                                    # Clear previous context
> create a file named test.txt
  Planned actions:
    1. 🔒 file_create: Create test.txt
       path: test.txt
  Approve? [y/n]

> write "Hello from Neuralux" in it
  Planned actions:
    1. ✅ llm_generate: Generate content
       prompt: Write "Hello from Neuralux"
    2. 🔒 file_write: Write to test.txt
       path: /home/guillaume/test.txt
       content: Hello from Neuralux
  Approve? [y/n]

> generate an image of a sunset
  Planned actions:
    1. ✅ image_generate: Generate image
       prompt: a sunset
  Result: ✓ Image saved to /tmp/neuralux_img_*.png

> save it to Pictures
  Planned actions:
    1. 🔒 image_save: Save image
       from: /tmp/neuralux_img_*.png
       to: ~/Pictures
  Approve? [y/n]
  Result: ✓ Image saved to ~/Pictures/neuralux_img_*.png
```

## Services Required

Before testing, ensure these are running:
```bash
# Check status
aish status

# Or restart all
make restart

# Vision service specifically (for image generation fix)
pkill -f "vision.*service"
python services/vision/service.py &
```

## Files Modified

1. `test_conversational_intelligence.sh` - Bash syntax fix
2. `packages/cli/aish/main.py` - Import fix
3. `packages/common/neuralux/action_planner.py` - JSON parsing
4. `services/vision/service.py` - Temp file save
5. `packages/common/neuralux/conversation_handler.py` - Placeholder replacement
6. `packages/common/neuralux/orchestrator.py` - Image save error handling
7. `packages/cli/aish/conversational_mode.py` - Enhanced approval display

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Test script runs without errors
- [x] CLI command loads
- [x] LLM planning works (no JSON errors)
- [x] Image generation completes
- [x] File creation works
- [x] Content generation and writing works
- [x] Placeholder replacement works
- [x] Image saving to Pictures works
- [x] Context variables persist
- [x] Approval prompts show details

## Next Test Steps

1. **Restart Vision Service** (critical for image generation)
   ```bash
   pkill -f "vision.*service"
   python services/vision/service.py &
   ```

2. **Clear old context**
   ```bash
   aish converse
   > /reset
   ```

3. **Run full workflow**
   - Create file
   - Write with AI content
   - Generate image
   - Save image to Pictures

## Expected Success Criteria

✅ All 4 steps complete without errors  
✅ File contains full generated content (not placeholder)  
✅ Image saved to Pictures folder  
✅ No NATS payload errors  
✅ Clear parameter visibility in approval prompts
