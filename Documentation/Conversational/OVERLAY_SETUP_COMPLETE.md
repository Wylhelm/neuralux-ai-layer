# ✅ Overlay Conversational Enhancement - Setup Complete!

**Status**: Ready to Use  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  

## Installation Complete ✅

The overlay has been successfully enhanced with conversational intelligence and is now ready to use!

### What Was Fixed

**Issue**: Module import error when running `aish overlay`
- The CLI package was installed in regular mode (copied to site-packages)
- Path calculation couldn't find the `packages/overlay` directory

**Solution**: Reinstalled CLI in development/editable mode
```bash
pip install -e packages/cli/
```

Now `aish` uses the source files directly, so all updates are immediately available.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start All Services

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
make start-all
```

### 2. Launch Overlay

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
aish overlay --hotkey --tray
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Hotkey: Ctrl+Space (X11)
Tray not available via in-process integration. Falling back to external helper...
External tray helper started.
2025-10-27 20:58:07 [info] Connected to NATS
2025-10-27 20:58:07 [info] Overlay window created
```

### 3. Open Overlay

Press **Ctrl+Space** (or Alt+Space if configured differently)

### 4. Enable Conversation Mode

Click the **💬 button** in the toolbar

You should see:
- View switches to conversation history
- Empty state: "Start a conversation!"
- Input placeholder: "Type your message..."

### 5. Try Your First Conversation

```
> create a file test.txt
```

**What happens:**
1. Your message appears (blue bubble, right side)
2. "Thinking..." spinner shows
3. AI response appears (gray bubble, left side)
4. Approval dialog shows the command
5. Click "Approve All"
6. Result card shows success

Then continue:
```
> write a haiku about coding in it
```

The AI knows "it" means the test.txt file you just created!

make start-all
```

## Testing Checklist

Try these workflows to test the system:

### Workflow 1: File Operations
```
> create a file notes.txt
> write 3 ideas about AI in it
> read it back to me
```

### Workflow 2: Image Generation
```
> generate an image of a sunset over mountains
> save it to my Desktop
```

### Workflow 3: Multi-step
```
> create a file quantum.txt and write a summary of quantum computing in it
```

### Workflow 4: Context References
```
> create a file story.txt
> write a short sci-fi story in it
> generate an image based on that story
> save the image to Pictures
```

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay won't start
```bash
# Check Python environment
source myenv/bin/activate
which python3

# Reinstall in editable mode
pip install -e packages/cli/
pip install -e packages/common/
```

### "Conversation handler not available"
```bash
# Start all services
make start-all

# Check NATS
docker ps | grep nats

# Check Redis
docker ps | grep redis
```

### Actions hang
```bash
# Check service logs
tail -f data/logs/llm-service.log
tail -f data/logs/filesystem-service.log
tail -f data/logs/vision-service.log
```

### Approval dialog doesn't show
- Try clicking outside and back into the overlay window
- Check for modal window focus issues
- Restart the overlay
