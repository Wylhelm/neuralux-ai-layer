# Voice Assistant Implementation - Complete âœ…

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Fully Operational - End-to-End Voice Conversations

## Summary

The Neuralux Voice Assistant has been successfully implemented, enabling fully interactive voice conversations with bidirectional audio (listen and speak), natural language understanding via LLM, and voice-based command approvals.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

### 1. Voice Assistant Command (`aish assistant`)

A new CLI command that creates an interactive conversation loop with **intelligent voice activity detection**:

```bash
# Single turn conversation
aish assistant

# Continuous conversation mode
aish assistant -c

# Custom maximum recording duration
aish assistant -d 10

# Force specific language
aish assistant -l fr

# Adjust silence detection (wait 2 seconds of silence before stopping)
aish assistant -s 2.0

# More sensitive silence detection (lower threshold)
aish assistant -t 0.005
```

### 2. Complete Conversation Flow

Each conversation turn includes:

1. **Voice Input (STT)**
   - Records audio from microphone with **intelligent voice activity detection**
   - Automatically stops recording when speech ends (configurable silence detection)
   - Supports natural pauses and longer speech without cutting off
   - Transcribes with CUDA-accelerated faster-whisper
   - Auto-detects language (EN/FR/50+ languages)
   - Real-time RMS-based silence detection

2. **Natural Language Processing (LLM)**
   - Sends transcribed text to LLM service via NATS
   - Includes conversation context (last 3 turns)
   - Generates concise, natural responses (<50 words)
   - Optimized for voice interaction

3. **Voice Output (TTS)**
   - Converts LLM response to speech with Piper
   - Automatic audio playback
   - Same language as user input

4. **Command Execution & Voice-Based Approvals**
   - Detects command requests (show, list, find, search, etc.)
   - Uses `ask_llm()` to translate natural language to shell commands
   - Presents command to user: "I'll run the command: <cmd>. Should I proceed?"
   - Asks "Should I proceed? Say yes or no"
   - Records approval response with **intelligent voice activity detection**
   - Automatically stops when approval is complete (shorter silence detection)
   - Transcribes and checks for yes/no
   - **If approved**: Executes command with `subprocess.run()`
   - **Output handling**: Shows full output on screen, speaks summary
   - **Error handling**: Catches errors, timeouts (30s), speaks error messages
   - Executes or cancels based on response

### 3. Conversation Context Management

- Maintains conversation history
- Passes last 3 turns (6 messages) to LLM
- Tracks user and assistant messages
- Natural conversation flow

### 4. Exit Handling

Voice keywords to end session:
- English: "exit", "quit", "goodbye", "good bye", "bye", "bye bye", "stop", "end", "finish", "close"
- French: "au revoir", "adieu"

### 5. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**Intelligent Recording Control:**
- **Real-time RMS Analysis**: Monitors audio volume in real-time during recording
- **Configurable Silence Detection**: Adjustable silence duration before stopping (default: 1.5s)
- **Volume Threshold**: Configurable sensitivity for speech detection (default: 0.01)
- **Natural Pauses**: Allows short pauses in speech without cutting off
- **Minimum Recording Time**: Ensures at least 1 second of recording before stopping
- **Maximum Recording Time**: Prevents infinite recording (configurable, default: 5s)

**Command-line Options (Assistant):**
- `-s, --silence-duration`: Seconds of silence before stopping (0.5-5.0)
- `-t, --silence-threshold`: Volume threshold for silence detection (0.001-0.1)
- `-d, --duration`: Maximum recording time per turn (1-60 seconds)

**Overlay Configuration:**
- `OVERLAY_VAD_SILENCE_THRESHOLD`: Volume threshold for silence detection (0.001-0.1)
- `OVERLAY_VAD_SILENCE_DURATION`: Seconds of silence before stopping (0.5-5.0)
- `OVERLAY_VAD_MAX_RECORDING_TIME`: Maximum recording time per turn (5-60 seconds)
- `OVERLAY_VAD_MIN_RECORDING_TIME`: Minimum recording time before stopping (1-5 seconds)

### 6. Integration Points

- **STT Service**: `ai.audio.stt` NATS subject
- **TTS Service**: `ai.audio.tts` NATS subject  
- **LLM Service**: `ai.llm.request` NATS subject
- **Message Format**: Uses proper LLM message format with roles
