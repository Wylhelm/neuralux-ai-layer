# Voice Assistant Implementation - Complete âœ…

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Fully Operational - End-to-End Voice Conversations

## Summary

The Neuralux Voice Assistant has been successfully implemented, enabling fully interactive voice conversations with bidirectional audio (listen and speak), natural language understanding via LLM, and voice-based command approvals.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

### 1. Voice Assistant Command (`aish assistant`)

A new CLI command that creates an interactive conversation loop:

```bash
# Single turn conversation
aish assistant

# Continuous conversation mode
aish assistant -c

# Custom recording duration
aish assistant -d 10

# Force specific language
aish assistant -l fr
```

### 2. Complete Conversation Flow

Each conversation turn includes:

1. **Voice Input (STT)**
   - Records audio from microphone
   - Transcribes with CUDA-accelerated faster-whisper
   - Auto-detects language (EN/FR/50+ languages)
   - VAD filtering for cleaner audio

2. **Natural Language Processing (LLM)**
   - Sends transcribed text to LLM service via NATS
   - Includes conversation context (last 3 turns)
   - Generates concise, natural responses (<50 words)
   - Optimized for voice interaction

3. **Voice Output (TTS)**
   - Converts LLM response to speech with Piper
   - Automatic audio playback
   - Same language as user input

4. **Command Execution & Voice-Based Approvals**
   - Detects command requests (show, list, find, search, etc.)
   - Uses `ask_llm()` to translate natural language to shell commands
   - Presents command to user: "I'll run the command: <cmd>. Should I proceed?"
   - Asks "Should I proceed? Say yes or no"
   - Records 3-second approval response
   - Transcribes and checks for yes/no
   - **If approved**: Executes command with `subprocess.run()`
   - **Output handling**: Shows full output on screen, speaks summary
   - **Error handling**: Catches errors, timeouts (30s), speaks error messages
   - Executes or cancels based on response

### 3. Conversation Context Management

- Maintains conversation history
- Passes last 3 turns (6 messages) to LLM
- Tracks user and assistant messages
- Natural conversation flow

### 4. Exit Handling

Voice keywords to end session:
- English: "exit", "quit", "goodbye", "good bye", "bye", "bye bye", "stop", "end", "finish", "close"
- French: "au revoir", "adieu"

### 5. Integration Points

- **STT Service**: `ai.audio.stt` NATS subject
- **TTS Service**: `ai.audio.tts` NATS subject  
- **LLM Service**: `ai.llm.request` NATS subject
- **Message Format**: Uses proper LLM message format with roles

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`packages/cli/aish/main.py`**
   - Added `AIShell.speak()` helper method
   - Added `assistant()` command with full conversation loop
   - Integrated STT, LLM, and TTS services
   - Implemented voice approval workflow

2. **`README.md`**
   - Added voice assistant examples

3. **`AUDIO.md`**
   - Added complete voice assistant documentation
   - Added example conversations

4. **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`**
   - Added voice assistant command reference

### Key Code Features

**Voice Recording:**
```python
# Records audio using PyAudio
# Configurable duration per turn
# Handles ALSA warnings gracefully
```

**LLM Integration:**
```python
# Uses proper message format with roles
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Neuralux..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_text}
]
response = await message_bus.request("ai.llm.request", {...})
```

**Conversation Loop:**
```python
# Maintains conversation history
# Supports single turn or continuous mode
# Handles errors gracefully
# Voice-based exit commands
```

**Voice Approvals:**
```python
# Detects approval keywords in response
# Records 3-second voice response
# Transcribes and checks for yes/no
# Executes or cancels accordingly
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Question
```
User: "What's your name?"
Assistant: "I'm Neuralux, your AI assistant for Linux. How can I help you today?"
```

### Example 2: Command Request
```
User: "Show me the files in this directory"
Assistant: "I'll run the command: ls -la. Should I proceed?"
User: "Yes"
Assistant: "Okay, executing now"
[Command executes: ls -la]
[Full output displayed on screen]
Assistant: "Here are the first results: total 512. drwxrwxr-x 15 user..."
```

### Example 3: Multi-turn Conversation (Continuous Mode)
```
Turn 1:
User: "Hello"
Assistant: "Hello! How can I assist you?"

Turn 2:
User: "What's the weather like?"
Assistant: "I don't have real-time weather access, but I can show you how to check. Would you like that?"

Turn 3:
User: "Yes please"
Assistant: "You can use 'curl wttr.in' to get weather information."

User: "goodbye"
Assistant: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
```
