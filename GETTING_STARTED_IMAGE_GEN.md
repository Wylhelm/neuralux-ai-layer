# Getting Started with Image Generation üé®

## What's New?

NeuroLux can now generate high-quality images using state-of-the-art Flux AI models! Click a button, describe what you want, and watch as beautiful images appear in seconds.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /home/guillaume/NeuroTuxLayer/services/vision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

‚è±Ô∏è This will take 2-3 minutes and download ~3 GB.

### Step 2: Start the Vision Service

```bash
cd /home/guillaume/NeuroTuxLayer/services/vision
python service.py
```

‚úÖ You should see: "Vision service connected to NATS and handlers registered"

### Step 3: Generate Your First Image

**Option A: Via Overlay (Easiest)**
1. Press `Alt+Space` to open NeuroLux overlay
2. Click the üé® (paint palette) button in the top-right
3. Type: "A serene mountain landscape at sunset with dramatic clouds"
4. Click "Generate"
5. Wait ~30 seconds (first time downloads models)
6. Click "Save Image" to save your creation!

**Option B: Via Test Script**
```bash
cd /home/guillaume/NeuroTuxLayer
python scripts/test_image_gen.py "A cute fluffy cat sitting on a windowsill"
```

**Option C: Via Command Line**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8005/v1/generate-image \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A majestic dragon flying over mountains",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "num_inference_steps": 4,
    "model": "flux-schnell"
  }' | jq -r '.image_bytes_b64' | base64 -d > dragon.png
```

## Important Notes

### ‚è≥ First Generation is Slow
The very first time you generate an image, it will download the Flux model (~12 GB). This can take 10-30 minutes depending on your internet speed. **This only happens once!**

After the model is downloaded, generation is fast:
- flux-schnell: 3-10 seconds per image
- flux-dev: 15-60 seconds per image

### üíæ Storage Requirements
- Models: ~15 GB (one-time download)
- Each generated image: ~2-5 MB
- Make sure you have at least 20 GB free disk space

### üñ•Ô∏è GPU Recommended
- **With GPU (NVIDIA)**: 3-10 seconds per image ‚ö°
- **Without GPU (CPU)**: 10-30 minutes per image üê¢

The feature works on both, but CPU generation is impractically slow for regular use.

## Verify Your Setup

### Check if Vision Service is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/
```

Should return:
```json
{"service": "vision_service", "version": "0.1.0", "status": "running"}
```

### Check GPU Detection
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If False, you're using CPU (slow but works).

### Check Model Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/v1/model-info | jq
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Connection refused" Error
**Problem**: Vision service isn't running  
**Solution**:
```bash
cd /home/guillaume/NeuroTuxLayer/services/vision
python service.py
```

### "CUDA out of memory" Error
**Problem**: GPU doesn't have enough VRAM  
**Solutions**:
- Use smaller size: 512x512 instead of 1024x1024
- Use flux-schnell instead of flux-dev
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Restart the vision service

### Very Slow Generation
**Problem**: Using CPU instead of GPU, or first-time model download  
**Check**:
```bash
# Check if CUDA is available
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Check service logs for "Loading model" messages
```

### Button Not Appearing in Overlay
**Problem**: Overlay not updated or not running  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Restart the overlay
killall python  # (be careful, this kills all python processes)
# Then start overlay again
```

## Example Prompts

Try these prompts to see what the models can do:

### Landscapes
```
A serene Japanese garden with cherry blossoms and a koi pond, soft morning light
```

### Portraits
```
Professional headshot of a confident businesswoman, studio lighting, shallow depth of field
```

### Fantasy
```
Ancient wizard's tower on a cliff overlooking a stormy sea, magical glow from windows
```

### Abstract
```
Vibrant geometric abstract art, Kandinsky style, bold colors and dynamic shapes
```

### Architecture
```
Modern sustainable eco-house with glass walls, surrounded by forest, architectural photography
```

### Animals
```
Majestic lion with a flowing mane, golden hour lighting, National Geographic style
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: "A red vintage bicycle leaning against a brick wall" is better than "a bicycle"
2. **Add style keywords**: "cinematic lighting", "oil painting", "photorealistic", "watercolor"
3. **Mention quality**: "high detail", "4K", "professional photography"
4. **Control mood**: "serene", "dramatic", "whimsical", "mysterious"
5. **Iterate**: Generate, refine prompt, regenerate

## Ready to Create?

Open the overlay (`Alt+Space`), click üé®, and start creating! 

**Remember**: First generation downloads models and takes longer. After that, enjoy near-instant AI art generation! ‚ú®

Happy creating! üé®üöÄ
